## Genesis Galleria: Where AI Meets Art

**Welcome to Genesis Galleria, a revolutionary platform where you can unleash your creativity and mint unique NFTs using the power of AI image generation!**

**Project Overview**

Genesis Galleria empowers you to become a co-creator alongside cutting-edge AI technology. Simply provide a text prompt describing your desired artwork, and our AI will craft a stunning, one-of-a-kind image. You can then mint this AI-generated masterpiece as an NFT, securing its ownership and value on the blockchain.

**Key Features**

- **Intuitive Prompt Creation:** Craft detailed or evocative text prompts to guide the AI towards your artistic vision.
- **AI-Powered Image Generation:** Witness the magic of AI as it transforms your prompts into captivating visuals.
- **NFT Minting:** Secure ownership of your AI-generated artwork on the blockchain by minting it as an NFT.
- **Genesis Galleria Collection:** Be a part of the inaugural collection, leaving your mark on the history of AI-powered art.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Description of the project:

Our innovative platform leverages the power of Next.js and Tailwind CSS to offer a seamless user experience for generating and minting custom NFTs. Utilizing OpenAI's latest model, users can input their unique prompts to create high-quality, precise images. These images can then be minted as NFTs with ease, thanks to our integration with Starknet L2 and Dynamic for wallet connectivity. By paying a nominal fee of 4 STRK per NFT, users can secure their custom digital assets on the blockchain, ensuring ownership and provenance. Our system ensures a smooth and efficient process, allowing users to engage with cutting-edge AI technology and blockchain in one unified platform.
